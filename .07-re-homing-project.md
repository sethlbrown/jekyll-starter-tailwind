Here at the Way of Compassion Bicycle Project, we recognize the positive Environmental impact of bicycles and bicycle lifestyle. We strive to create a support for our cycling community through our service, used parts, build-a-bike program, and bicycle maintenance workshops and open shop times. During the Spring, Summer, and Fall of 2019 we will be engaging in a materials processing program of our donated inventory. We have recognized the importance of the bicycle project as a ‘filter’ for abandoned and donated used bicycles.

Thanks to a grant from The Aspen Skiing Company Environment Foundation, we are enthusiastic to operate a special bicycle processing and rehoming project. Our goal is to sort through and process over 200 bicycles that have been donated to the Way of Compassion Bicycle Project over the years. ⅓ of the bicycles will be processed into usable parts and recycling, ⅓ will be donated to bicycles for humanity or other programs, and ⅓ will be reserved for overhauling and being put back on the road in our local communities and beyond.

We will need your help! We are operating 6 volunteer days for processing these bicycles. You can join in to help deconstruct bicycles, organize parts, separate recycling from usable parts, and refurbish bicycles for the community.

* No mechanical expertise is needed.
* Please bring clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty, 
* Bring sunscreen and water
*  We will provide Burritos thanks to Dos Gringos Burritos in Carbondale.
